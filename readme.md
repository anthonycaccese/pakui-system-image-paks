## Additional Resources

### Create your own

The resources directory includes a set of masks that can be used to create your own images in the same style as the sets in this repo.  I've included a mask for Affinity Design and an SVG.

## **Credits**

- Most of the controller graphics in the `Controllers` set were sourced from the work of [Pineapple_Graphics](https://archive.org/details/full-color-pngs)
- All icon graphics in the `Icons` set were sourced from the work of [Zoidburg13](https://github.com/Zoidburg13/ES-DE-System-Icon-Set)
- The `Noir` set images were created and provided by [tenlevels](https://www.reddit.com/user/tenlevels/) with help from f8less and inspired by the artwork from the Epic Noir theme by [chicuelo](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir)
